Parago
===========

### Introduction
Derived from the Greek word for productivity, Parago is a Chrome extension that keeps you on track. Based on the Pomodoro technique, a timer counts down 25 minutes for work and then 5 minutes for a break. Then, you're asked to input the one main task you completed during the 25 minute block of time. At the end of the day, you can switch over to the Visualizer tab to see how you spent most of your day, whether studying your math homework or surfing the web.

## Inspiration
In a remote school or work from home setting, it's too easy to spend your entire day in front of your computer and not get anything done. Parago takes on this problem in two different ways: by increasing your focus and your accountability.
