Parago
===========

### Introduction
Derived from the Greek word for productivity, Parago is a Chrome extension that keeps you on track. Based on the Pomodoro technique, a timer counts down 25 minutes for work and then 5 minutes for a break. Then, you're asked to input the one main task you completed during the 25 minute block of time. At the end of the day, you can switch over to the Visualizer tab to see how you spent most of your day, whether studying your math homework or surfing the web.

### Inspiration
In a remote school or work from home setting, it's too easy to spend the entire day in front of your computer and not get anything done. Our friends, peers, and parents constantly complain about how time slips away with no productive result. Parago takes on this problem in two different ways: by increasing your focus using the Pomodoro Technique and your accountability by allowing you to see how you spent your time.

### Technologies
Javascript, CSS, HTML

### Launch

### What's next
We would like to add more customizability; for example, so that you can change the length of the timer or the way the data is displayed. We think it would be really cool to use a Natural Language Processing API on the 'task' that the user enters, so that even if the user enters slightly different tasks (e.g., studying math vs. studying science), Parago can intelligently group those together in the data visualization chart. Finally, we would love to get Parago on the Chrome Webstore so that our friends and family can start using it!
We're also open to suggestions :)
